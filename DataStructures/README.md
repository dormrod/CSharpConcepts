## Stack

Prioritised collection, with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access. 
Has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion/deletion and O(n) for search/arbitrary access.

## Queue

Prioritised collection, with First-In-Last-Out (FILO) access.
Has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion/deletion and O(n) for search/arbitrary access.

## Linked List

Collection where each node has a reference to the next node (and the previous node also if doubly-linked).
Has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion/deletion and O(n) for search/arbitrary access.

## Hash Table

Key-value pair based collection.
Has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertion/deletion and search.
